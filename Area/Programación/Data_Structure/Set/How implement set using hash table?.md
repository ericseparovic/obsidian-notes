A hash table consists of an array of buckets (or slots). Each bucket stores a list (or chain) of elements that share the same hash value. A hash function maps each element to an index in the array.

Key: The element itself (e.g., integer, string).
Value: In the case of a set, the value is usually just a placeholder (e.g., true), indicating that the key exists in the set.
