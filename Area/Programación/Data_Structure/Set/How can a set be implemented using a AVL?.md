A set can be implemented using an AVL tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis tree), which is a self-balancing binary search tree. In this implementation, the set is represented as a balanced binary tree where each node stores a unique element. The AVL tree ensures that the height difference (balance factor) between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1, which maintains logarithmic time complexity for key operations
