A set can be implemented using a linked list by storing each unique element as a node. The list ensures that duplicates are not allowed. Operations include insertion, deletion, and search, where each element is stored only once in the list.

**Advantages:**

- **Dynamic Size:** No predefined size; can grow or shrink as needed.
- **Efficient Memory Usage:** Memory is allocated only when elements are added.
- **Simple Implementation:** Especially useful for dynamic sets that change over time.
